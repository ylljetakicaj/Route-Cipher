# Route-Cipher

A route cipher is a type of encryption technique that rearranges plaintext in a specific pattern to create a ciphertext. This technique involves writing the plaintext in a grid or matrix, and then rearranging the letters in a specific way, typically by reading the letters in a predetermined pattern or route.
